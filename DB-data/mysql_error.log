sThis could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

sTo report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

eWe will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

rServer version: 10.4.27-MariaDB
tkey_buffer_size=16777216
iread_buffer_size=262144
omax_used_connections=0
nmax_threads=65537
:thread_count=6
 It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
sHope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

lThread pointer: 0x0
otAttempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
